We are seeking Postdocs, Research Scientists, and PhD students interested in computational neuroscience and learning. We are committed to building an inclusive workplace that prizes open communication, teamwork, and curiosity.

## Postdocs and Research Scientists

If you're interested in joining the lab as a full-time postdoc or research scientist, please send an email to <img src="{{ email_path }}" style="display: inline; width: 25%; min-width: 10em; " /> describing your scientific background, research interests, and your CV with references. To get the conversation started, please include a brief research proposal of something you think we could work on together.

We have collaborations with many experimental labs on a variety of topics, or you can bring your own experimental data as well. We offer competitive salaries and benefits.

Candidates should have a PhD or equivalent in neuroscience, statistics, computer science, engineering, mathematics, or a related field. Ideal candidates will have solid programming skills and comfort with linear algebra and statistics.

## PhD students

Before you can join the lab as a graduate student, you must first be admitted to a PhD program at Baylor College of Medicine or Rice University. Please consider applying to the [Neuroscience](https://www.bcm.edu/education/graduate-school-of-biomedical-sciences/degree-programs-and-certificates/neuroscience) or [Quantitative & Computational Biosciences](https://www.bcm.edu/education/graduate-school-of-biomedical-sciences/degree-programs-and-certificates/quantitative-computational-biosciences) PhD programs at Baylor College of Medicine, and/or the [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.rice.edu/academics/graduate-programs/graduate-admissions) PhD program at Rice University. The application period typically begins in September.

Once you have decided to apply to one of these programs, email <img src="{{ email_path }}" style="display: inline; width: 25%; min-width: 10em; " /> for rotation opportunities, including your CV and a sample of code you have written.

Prior programming experience is expected, as is a background in mathematics, statistics, computer science, or electrical/biomedical engineering.
