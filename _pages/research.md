Our lab's goal is to understand how animals and people learn in terms of changes in the brain's neural activity. To do this, we take three general approaches:

- __theory__ (e.g., normative models: "How _should_ someone learn this task?")
- __machine learning__ (e.g., artificial agents trained with reinforcement learning)
- __neural data analysis__ (e.g., statistical models of high-dimensional neural activity)

Some of our past and current work considers learning in the following contexts:

- neural control of movement in motor cortex, using brain-computer interfaces (BCI)
- reinforcement learning in the dopamine system, using recurrent neural network (RNN) models

You can browse our [publications](/publications) for summaries of our work in this area.

Moving forward, our lab has two additional research interests: __meta-learning__ ("learning to learn"), and __the emergence of probabilistic representations__ in the brain.

<!-- Learning can be defined simply as systematic improvements in performance at a given task. As for how changes in the brain actually give rise to learning, there are many key questions. What objective is the brain optimizing, and how is this selected? What are the learning rules? What are the constraints? -->
