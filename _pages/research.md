Our lab's goal is to understand how animals and people learn in terms of changes in the brain's neural activity. To do this, we take three general approaches:

- __theory__ (e.g., normative models: "How _should_ an agent learn this task?")
- __machine learning__ (e.g., artificial agents trained with reinforcement learning)
- __neural data analysis__ (e.g., statistical models of high-dimensional neural activity)

Some of our past and current work considers learning in the following contexts:

- neural control of movement in motor cortex, using brain-computer interfaces (BCI)
- reinforcement learning in the dopamine system, using recurrent neural network (RNN) models

Moving forward, our lab has two additional research interests: __meta-learning__ ("learning to learn"), and __the emergence of probabilistic representations__.
